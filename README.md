- **Database Integration**: SQLite used to maintain student records.
- **Python-Powered**: The backend logic is implemented using Python.

## Requirements
To run the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **SQLite** (bundled with Python)
- **tkinter** for GUI management (part of Python's standard library)

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
Follow these steps to get the project running locally:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/StudentHub.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd StudentHub
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure Python and any necessary libraries are installed (see Requirements).
   
4. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
- Upon launching the app, you will see the **Student Dashboard**.
- You can add new student records, view the existing student list, and manage the database using the intuitive interface.
- Screenshots are included in the project folder to help you visualize the features and functionalities.

### Running the Project
- Simply run `python main.py` from your terminal. The GUI will launch, and you can interact with the student management system.

## Database Details
The project uses an **SQLite** database (`student_data.db`). It stores information related to students, and all data is structured efficiently within this database.

If the database needs to be recreated or migrated, ensure you run the following script (if included):
```bash
python initialize_db.py
```

This command will help reset or initialize the database in case of data corruption or changes in schema.
